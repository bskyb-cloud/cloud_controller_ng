Repo Notes
----------
This repo contains the next generation Cloud Controller for Cloud Foundry.
Developers should be aware that this is a temporary repo.  The Cloud Foundry
team is about to do a refactor of the primary VCAP repo into a repo per
component.  Once that is done, the history for cloud_controller_ng repo will
get picked up and moved to a branch on a refactored Cloud Controller repo.
This will let us keep the history for the old and new Cloud Controller in a
single repo.
